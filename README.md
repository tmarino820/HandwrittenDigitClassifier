# Handwritten Digit Classifier

This project implements a simple multi-layer neural network with Batch Normalization Regularization to solve the problem of handwritten digit classification. Images of digits come from the built-in MNIST dataset in Keras, and the model parameters are stored and saved in a newly created directory after initially running the program. Much of the code used in this project comes from Deep Learning Illustrated, Tensorflow, and Stack Overflow.
